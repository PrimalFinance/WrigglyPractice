## Problem 6: Variable Check

<small>Description: Write a function to determine if the pool is in a valid state: Initialized</small>

## Problem 7: Simple Require

<small>Description: Use a require statement to check if the operation will result in an "overflow".</small>

## Problem 8: String Storage

<small>Description: Write a smart contract that can store and retrieve a string value. </small>

## Problem 9: Voting System

<small>Description: Create a Solidity contract called "Voting" that allows users to vote on a given set of proposals.</small>

## Problem 10: Transfer Ether

<small>Description: Write a function that transfers Ether from the contract balance to an address.</small>

## Problem 11: Simple Hash

<small>Description: Use the keccak256() hasing function built into Solidity to hash a string message.</small>

## Problem 12: Simple Modifiers One

<small>Description: Use different function modifiers to access data. </small>

## Problem 13: Build NFT One

<small>Description: Create a smart-contract that allows users to mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and keep track of the ownership of these tokens. The contract should be based on the ERC-721 standard. </small>

## Problem 14: Contract Owner

<small>Description: Return the address of the owner of the contract. </small>

## Problem 15: User Registration

<small>Description: Implement a smart contract that allows uers to register their personal information, including their name and email. The contract should store the information permanently on the blockchain and allow users to retriever their own information at any time. </small>

## Problem 16: Team Players

<small>Description: Create a smart contract that keeps track of players addresses, and their jersey numbers. The contract should be able to add or remove players, or update an existing players information. Only the owner of the contract should be able to make these changes. </small>

## Problem 17: Safe Math

<small>Description: Use the "@openzeppelin/contracts" library "SafeMath". Implement this library for the mathmatical functions provided.</small>

## Problem 18: Build NFT Two

<small>Description: Create a smart contract that allows users to mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with metadata stored on IPFS and keep track of the ownership of these tokens. </small>

## Problem 19: Simple Modifiers Three

<small>Description: Write a smart contract that allows the owner of the contract to set a number and retrieve it. The contract should have a custom modifier that ensures only only the contract owner can call the "setNumber()" function. Additionally, the "getNumber()" function should only be accessible within the contract itself. </small>

## Problem 20: Fix Keyword One

<small>Description: The code contains a bug. Fixe the keyword to allow the contract to run. </small>

## Problem 21: Gas Estimator

<small>Description: Write a function in Solidity that estimates the amount of gas required to deploy a given contract. The function should take as input the contract bytecode as "bytes". </small>

## Problem 22: Build Token One

<small>Description: Using the ERC-20 standard, build your own token. Mint the entire initial supply to yourself. </small>

## Problem 23: Build Token Two

<small>Description: Implement the ERC-20's "\_mint()", "\_burn()", and "getBalance()" functions. </small>
