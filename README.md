## Problem 38: Employee Payroll

<small>
Url: https://www.wriggly.io/problems/employee-payroll

Description: A company wants to implement a smart contract that facilitates weekly wage payments to its employees. The company wants to automate the payment process, so the employees receive their wages each week without requiring manual intervention. The contract needs to be secure, transparent, and auditable.

The company needs to be able to add funds to the contract and specify the amount to be paid to each employee each week. The contract should maintain a record of all payments made to each employee and ensure that no employee can be paid more than their designated weekly amount. In addition, the contract should allow employees to withdraw their wages at any time.

The contract should be designed in such a way that it can handle a large number of employees and payments without any performance issues. The contract should also be flexible enough to allow the company to add or remove employees and adjust the payment amounts as needed.

Overall, the company wants a smart contract that can automate the wage payment process, increase transparency, and reduce the risk of errors or fraud.</small>

## Problem 39: Contract Expiration

<small>
Url: https://www.wriggly.io/problems/employee-payroll

Description: Create a Solidity smart contract that can check whether it has expired or not based on a specific duration of time. Set the creationTime to the current block timestamp.

## Problem 40: Bytecode One

<small>
Url: https://www.wriggly.io/problems/bytecode-one

Description: The contract should have a function called getBytecode that returns the bytecode of the contract in which the function is defined. The bytecode should be returned as a bytes array. You should complete the code using inline assembly in Solidity. The inline assembly code should use the extcodecopy opcode to copy the bytecode of the contract to a dynamically allocated bytes array. The code should also ensure that the length of the bytes array matches the length of the bytecode.</small>

## Problem 41: Bytecode Two

<small>
Url: https://www.wriggly.io/problems/bytecode-two

Description: This is a varition to Bytecode One. In addition to returning the bytecode of the contract like in Bytecode One, we also want to initiliaze the bytes array with a header, followed by the contract address size and the extcodesize. We want to use the shl() function to generate the contract's address and prepend it to the bytecode. In Bytecode One, the byecode array only contained the bytecode itself, without the header or metadata. In this version, we want the bytecode array to contain additional metadata, including the header and the sizes of the contract address and bytecode.</small>

## Problem 42: Reverse String

<small>
Url: https://www.wriggly.io/problems/reverse-string

Description: Here we have two functions, setMessage and reverseMessage. Your job is to ensure \_newMessage is not an empty string and then initialize message. Your next task is to reverse the string message.</small>
